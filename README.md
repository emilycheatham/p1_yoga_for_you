## Design

Yoga is renound for aiding mental health, and being a time to be calm, focused and in the now. As a result, the project's design arises from this theme. It aims to be calming and peaceful. It aims to have enough contrast to draw the viewer's eye to intended element, and be contrasting enought to be accessible for all users, whilst maintiaing the calming ethos. 

### Colour Scheme

![Palette](assets/images/readme/colorpalette.png)

The colour palette was selected to envoke feelings of calmness and relaxation. The palette was generated using the [Color hunt wesbite](https://colorhunt.co/). The green, white and pink is often echoed through yoga photos echoing the practitioner's clothes, skin and location. 

### Typography
Through the exploration of the [fontpair wesbite](https://www.fontpair.co/) the combination of the following fonts were used from Google fonts:
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) This was was chosen for the main body as it was neutral and easy to read.

[Hind](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind) was used for the headings at all levels.

### Images

The images in this project were sourced from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).All images on this website are free stockp hotos which are royalty free. The images were selected as they showed individuals doing yoga and different yoga classes. The studios in the image linked with the ethos and theme I was trying to create. The colours also correlated with the colour palette used. 

### Accessibility

- Active tags have been added to menus to allow screen readers to see which page is currently open.
- Aria labels have been added on all images across the site to provide information to screen readers.
- Scope labels have been used on the table to aid screen readers to view the information

### Visual Effects

#### Shadows

As it will stay at the top of the screen as you scroll down, a box-shadow was added to the nav bar to allow for it to seem like it is 3D and be seperate to the other sections.

#### Hover on images

To increase users engagment, and to reduce writing on screen for better visual effect, hover has been used on some images. When hovering over event classes, it provides information about the name, time and requirments/limiaations of the class.
![Example of hover](assets/images/readme/hover.png)

#### Hover on table

To make the classes table easier to read, the whole row turns pink when hovered over. This makes it easier to see a set style of yoga and the times that class is offered throughout the week.

#### Navbar Hover effect

To make the experience more interactive, the nav bar includes a hover-over effect for desktops. The text displays as pink, but the hover is #3a3a3a to make it stand out.

#### Buttons

The submit button on the sign up page grows (1.2) when hovered over. The font also becomes underlined in pink when hovered over. When pressed, if the form is filled in correctly, it will take you to the thank-you page.

#### Links

Hover has also been used on anchors. When hovered over, they will underline the text. This can be seen in the nav and the footer. Additionally, on the homepage, two anchors have been stylised like buttons to stand out.

Based on a media quesry, for mobile devices it become a dropdown "hamburger menu" feature. This allows for a better use of the space on smaller devices.

- **Hero image**

This section is the first thing the user sees opening the home page. It is clear what the site is about. It uses colours that match the colour scheme. The image involve a range of people of different ages, genders and races, showing the inclusive nature of the studio.
The semi-transparent overlay draws the eye, making it very clear what the site is about and where to find the studio. this stretches 60% over the width of the image.

![Hero](assets/images/readme/hero.png)

On smaller devices, the semi-transparent overlay is 80% width to ensure all text is included whilst still being clear.

![Why-practice-yoga-desktop](assets/images/readme/practice-desktop.png)



- **Types of yoga offered section**

This section allows the user to have  brief overview of the different types of yoga offered in the studio. It gives enough information for users to be able to decide based on their experience and any physical requirements.

The divs are resposive. When in mobile view, the text is above the table. The table can be scrolled left to right so all information can be seen even on smaller devices with overflow.
On larger devices, the text moves to the left of the table, and the table expands to fill the width of the device's screen.

![Footer-desktop](assets/images/readme/footer-desktop.png)

## Feature Considerations

### Signup form processing

Currently, once the form on the Sign Up page is completed, it takes you to a thank you page. The data is not being processed or stored. This is also due to it being a fictional company. However, the data would ideally be stored, processed and analysed. Using this, online booking could be made with instant feedback, instead of having to wait for an e-mail response. This would make it more efficient for the compnay, and provide a more efficient and personalised quality experience for the user. 

### Popup preview of Google Maps

In the wireframes, googlemaps was intetend to be placed in the footer. This was removed as I felt it would have been too large. This could be used in the About Us page, or as a pop up feature when the address in the footer is clicked on/hovered over.

### Link buttons
Originally the anchor links on the index page and the thank you page were buttons. They grew when you hovered over them. However, validator checks didn't like buttons and anchors together. I would like to redo these so they all look the same, and increase in size when hovered. The font would need shaning to stand out more. I would like it to link to a certain section rather than just a page.

### Accessibility

Whilst the lighthouse checks rated the accessibily in the 90's, there is still room for improvement. One of the suggestions was that background and foreground colours do not have sufficent contrast ratio. Therefore, I would intend on experimenting with changing these to improve this contrast futher whist still maintaining the colour scheme.
I would use the site I found at the end of my project, Toptal [Colorfilter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/)to improve access for those with colour-blindness.

# Solved issues

The following issues arose and were solved through testing, tutor meetings, and peer advice.

- The table was too large and was overflowing into white space - a overflow-x scroll bar was added. 
- The section that the table was in had white space on smaller devices - a div was added around the whole section and overflow: hidden was added.
- The sign up form was too small - text size was increased, padding added and block element added to the text-input.
- The text input sections overflowed out of the space, especially on smaller devices. A fiv with flex was added, and text overfolow: hidden.
- Inital testing on lighthouse raised that images were slowing down performance - images cropped and resized to fit space. Images converted to webp.
